I would like you to help me to build that Console App step by step.
I need also you're suggestions.
I think i will add this application to my resume to help to land my first job as Software developer.
also i believe my level close to entry - junior something like that. i would like to know what do you believe.
so i need to be a good written code.

Here it is what i did so far: I will send the code in separate parts because you have limitation at 4000 letters.
I will inform you when the code i send you is complete and then let me know what you think and your suggestions.
